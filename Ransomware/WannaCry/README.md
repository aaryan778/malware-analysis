## Summary

  WannaCry is a ransomware worm that spread rapidly through across a number of computer networks in May of 2017. 
  After infecting a Windows computers, it encrypts files on the PC's hard drive, making them impossible for users to access, then demands a ransom payment in bitcoin in order to decrypt them.

  A number of factors made the initial spread of WannaCry particularly noteworthy: it struck a number of important and high-profile systems, including many in Britain's National Health Service; it exploited a Windows vulnerability that was suspected to have been first discovered by the United States National Security Agency; and it was tentatively linked by Symantec and other security researchers to the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime organization that may be connected to the North Korean government.
 
## Who was behind the attack?

   The attack used Eternalblue, the name given to the software vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows operating system, and works by exploiting the Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0. The Server Message Block (SMB) is a network file sharing protocol and ‘allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services’ that are on the same network.

   Ironically, it was allegedly developed as a cyber-attack exploit by the US National Security Agency.  Although they were reported to have known of the tool’s vulnerabilities, the NSA didn’t bring it to Microsoft’s attention until the hacker group called Shadow Brokers leaked EternalBlue to an obscure website.

   Further analysis of the attack by companies such as Symantec revealed links to the Lazarus group who in turn have been linked to North Korea although the attack does not bear the hallmarks of a nation-state campaign.
   
## What caused the attack?
   
   On Tuesday, March 14, 2017, Microsoft issued a security bulletin, which detailed the flaw and announced that patches had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time. The Department of Health was warned about the risks of cyber-attacks on the NHS a year before WannaCry and although it had work under way it did not formally respond with a written report until July 2017.

   At the time of the attacks, the NHS was criticized for using outdated IT systems, including Windows XP, a 17-year-old operating system that could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In an unusual move, Microsoft released a WannaCry patch for unsupported systems such as Windows XP which Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.

   The NHS had not rehearsed for a national cyber-attack it was not immediately clear who should lead the response. There were problems with communications because emails were either infected or shut down to prevent the ransomware spreading. It’s clear that the disaster recovery plan at the time had not accounted for a cyber-attack of this scale nor were there communication contingencies if the main network was inaccessible. There was no clear relationship between trusts infected by WannaCry and the quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality Commission.

## Details of the Ransomware Worm
  
   
* **Virus Name**: WannaCrypt, WannaCry, WanaCrypt0r, WCrypt, WCRY
* **Vector**: All Windows versions before Windows 10 are vulnerable if not patched for MS-17-010. It uses EternalBlue MS17-010 to propagate.
* **Ransom**: between $300 to $600. There is code to 'rm' (delete) files in the virus. Seems to reset if the virus crashes.
* **Backdooring**: The worm loops through every RDP session on a system to run the ransomware as that user. It also installs the DOUBLEPULSAR backdoor. It corrupts shadow volumes to make recovery harder. (source: malwarebytes)
* **Kill switch**: If the website `www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com` is up the virus exits instead of infecting the host. (source: malwarebytes). This domain has been sinkholed, stopping the spread of the worm. Will not work if proxied ([source](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2017/05/13/quickpost-wcry-killswitch-check-is-not-proxy-aware/)).

*Update*: A minor variant of the virus has been found, it looks to have had the killswitch hexedited out. Not done by recompile so probably not done by the original malware author. On the other hand that is the only change: the encryption keys are the same, the bitcoin addresses are the same. On the other hand it is corrupt so the ransomware aspect of it doesn't work - it only propagates.

Exploit details: https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/04/doublepulsar-initial-smb-backdoor-ring.html

# Vulnerable/Not Vulnerable

To be infected requires the SMB port (445) to be open, or the machine already infected with DOUBLEPULSAR (and killswitch not registered or somehow blocked, or the network accessing it through a proxy).

The MS17-010 patch fixes the vulnerability.

* Windows XP: Doesn't spread. If run manually, can encrypt files.
* Windows 7,8,2008: can spread unpatched, can encrypt files.
* Windows 10: Doesn't spread. Even though Windows 10 [does have the faulty SMB driver](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3196825/microsoft-windows/how-to-make-sure-your-windows-pc-wont-get-hit-by-ransomware-like-wannacrypt.html).
* Linux: Doesn't spread. If run manually with wine, can encrypt files.

# Cryptography details

* Each infection generates a new RSA-2048 keypair.
* The public key is exported as blob and saved to 00000000.pky
* The private key is encrypted with the ransomware public key and saved as 00000000.eky
* Each file is encrypted using AES-128-CBC, with a unique AES key per file.
* Each AES key is generated CryptGenRandom.
* The AES key is encrypted using the infection specific RSA keypair.

The RSA public key used to encrypt the infection specific RSA private key is embedded inside the DLL and owned by the ransomware authors.

* https://haxx.in/key1.bin (the ransomware pubkey, used to encrypt the users private key)
* https://haxx.in/key2.bin (the dll decryption privkey)
the CryptImportKey() rsa key blob dumped from the DLL by blasty.

# File types

There are a number of files and folders wannacrypt will avoid. Some because it's entirely pointless and others because it might destabilize the system. During scans, it will search the path for the following strings and skip over if present:

*   "Content.IE5"
*   "Temporary Internet Files"
*   " This folder protects against ransomware. Modifying it will reduce protection"
*   "\Local Settings\Temp"
*   "\AppData\Local\Temp"
*   "\Program Files (x86)"
*   "\Program Files"
*   "\WINDOWS"
*   "\ProgramData"
*   "\Intel"
*   "$\"

The filetypes it looks for to encrypt are:

.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pst, .ost, .msg, .eml, .vsd, .vsdx, .txt, .csv, .rtf, .123, .wks, .wk1, .pdf, .dwg, .onetoc2, .snt, .jpeg, .jpg, .docb, .docm, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .xlsm, .xlsb, .xlw, .xlt, .xlm, .xlc, .xltx, .xltm, .pptm, .pot, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppam, .potx, .potm, .edb, .hwp, .602, .sxi, .sti, .sldx, .sldm, .sldm, .vdi, .vmdk, .vmx, .gpg, .aes, .ARC, .PAQ, .bz2, .tbk, .bak, .tar, .tgz, .gz, .7z, .rar, .zip, .backup, .iso, .vcd, .bmp, .png, .gif, .raw, .cgm, .tif, .tiff, .nef, .psd, .ai, .svg, .djvu, .m4u, .m3u, .mid, .wma, .flv, .3g2, .mkv, .3gp, .mp4, .mov, .avi, .asf, .mpeg, .vob, .mpg, .wmv, .fla, .swf, .wav, .mp3, .sh, .class, .jar, .java, .rb, .asp, .php, .jsp, .brd, .sch, .dch, .dip, .pl, .vb, .vbs, .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .js, .asm, .h, .pas, .cpp, .c, .cs, .suo, .sln, .ldf, .mdf, .ibd, .myi, .myd, .frm, .odb, .dbf, .db, .mdb, .accdb, .sql, .sqlitedb, .sqlite3, .asc, .lay6, .lay, .mml, .sxm, .otg, .odg, .uop, .std, .sxd, .otp, .odp, .wb2, .slk, .dif, .stc, .sxc, .ots, .ods, .3dm, .max, .3ds, .uot, .stw, .sxw, .ott, .odt, .pem, .p12, .csr, .crt, .key, .pfx, .der

# Dissecting WannaCry Ransomware

The WannaCrypt ransomware was basically having 3 components that helps in carrying out the attack. Below are the components with their hash values:

* Dropper – 24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c
* Encrypter – ed01ebfbc9eb5bbea545af4d01bf5f1071661840480439c6e5babe8e080e41aa

 ## Static Analysis
 
 Before proceeding with the code analysis I wanted to have a look at the metadata of the file as this gives out a lot of valuable information which can be beneficial in the later analysis. I always prefer to first look at the strings before deeply analyzing any malware sample. Some of the interesting strings that I found during analysis are mentioned below:
